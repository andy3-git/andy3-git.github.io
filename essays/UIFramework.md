## What is a UI Framework

For those that don’t know, A UI Framework is a set of tools, and programs for developers to help build the visual and interactive parts of the program.
They are essentially pre-made toolkits designed so that developers can create User Interfaces without having to build them from the ground up every time. 
UI Frameworks are important for essentially four reasons. 
The first reason which was already discussed was that UI Frameworks save time by reusing components already made rather than creating User Interfaces from scratch.
The second reason is that it promotes consistency though enforcing an organized code. 
The third reason is its responsiveness, including designs that are mobile friendly. 
The final reason is that UI Frameworks are accessible, where certain frameworks have built in support for keyboard navigation and screen readers. 

##  Example of a S.M.A.R.T Question
A quick rundown of Bootstrap is that it is a UI Framework that contains pre-built components as well as a grid system, Bootstrap utilizes programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
Now during my time in ICS 314 - Software Engineering. I was tasked to ‘clone’ another website. 
The condition of the website chosen was that the target was to contain a navbar, footer, several dropdown menus, and that the website was not chosen by another classmate at the time, etc. 
although the links do not need to work. My website chosen was a [Rockstar Newswire](https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/) as it completes all of these requirements and that I was a fan of them at the time.
The implementation of certain basic elements such as the footer and navbar felt pretty simple as well as the background. 
Acquiring the images for the clone site was as simple as screenshotting the actual images from the real website. 
However, I had a hard time implementing the advanced stuff such as the navbar moving whilst scrolling, the animation of certain buttons and images when hovered over, and certain artforms that blended with the background. 
Other than that, I feel that Bootstrap 5 is an easy and efficient way to come up with a basic User Interface, rather than just creating a UI from scratch. However, it lacks complete control that raw CSS and HTML have. 

## Pros and Cons of Bootstrap
Like all options in life, they have their pros and cons.
For one bootstrap allows for quicker development times using their ready to use grids and layout system. 
In terms of scalability, Bootstrap is adequate for teams or projects of large scale and is accessible for programs on mobile as well. 
However, there are some notable cons as well. The main ones being that making a website purely of Bootstrap can look generic as it lacks full control of all pixels.
HTML and CSS allow the programmer to style their project however they wish. 
Furthermore, file sizes for bootstrap can be bloated as Bootstrap includes many CSS and HTML files that may not be necessary. 

## Epilogue
Overall, I think that bootstrap is a useful tool for making a quick User interface such as a Navbar, background colors, and footer. 
Bootstrap scales well with large projects and teams and having these frameworks can save plenty of time when making User Interfaces. 
Like everything in life, there are cons. For one, there is significantly less control over styling when compared to CSS and HTML. 
Another drawback is that file sizes when utilizing Bootstrap are bloated due to potentially unused CSS and HTML assets. 
And finally, the last disadvantage is that bootstrap code by itself can be harder to read, leading to new developers struggling to understand. 
This ends my writing on UI Frameworks, how I used and felt about Bootstrap, and the many pros and cons of Bootstrap.
