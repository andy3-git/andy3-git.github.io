## What is ESLint

ESlint is a development tool that identifies and fixes common problems within Typescript or Javascript code. 
The problems that ESlint finds range from syntax errors, coding bugs, and style issues before compile starts. 
Without this tool, the programmer might find themselves surprised when bugs sneak past, common malpractice slips through, code becomes messier, and/or conflicts arise within a team. 
These problems ultimately lead to a foundation that is hard to maintain, debug, and update. 
Having an automatic code checker such as ESLint prevents these problems from occurring. 

## Impressions and Struggles of ESLint

Unfortunately, I was not able to get ESLint to function properly for my VSCode. 
My Software Engineering class required ESLint and VSCode to function properly for some of the practice problems and I could not get ESLint into an operable state. 
Thus, I am not able to deliver a proper impression of ESLint from experience. 
However, I saw a video of one of my professors using ESlint and I think that this tool is very useful and would make solving errors or prevention of them easier. 
In regards to coding standards, ESlint would definitely help save time and organize code. 


## How I Feel About Coding Standards

How I feel personally about coding standards depends on the context. 
Am I working with a team, or am I working by myself? Am I trying to make a program for serious use, or am I just making something for fun and not taking it seriously? 
If I am working with a team and/or we’re taking this seriously, 
then yes I feel that coding standards should be followed so that there’s cohesion and better understanding for others reading the code. 
However, If it’s just myself or if I'm with a group of coders that are creating just for fun then my coding standards become lighter.
