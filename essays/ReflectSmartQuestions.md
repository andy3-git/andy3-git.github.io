## Importance of SMART Questions and What Are They...

S.M.A.R.T questions are important in Software Engineering and StackOverflow as they ensure clear communication which encourages constructive dialogue amongst others, 
a willingness to learn which shows that one is willing to understand and not just want a hand out wrapped in code, and an indication of respect to one another’s time. 
In this community filled with technical people, these qualities are valued and can go a long way in one’s career. 
Otherwise, not following these guidelines will leave the asker open to dismissal, appear as lazy or negligent to learning the code, 
the opportunity loss in understanding why which leads to gaps in knowledge down the line, and cause the frustration in many viewers as they try to understand the question, 
to which leads to less likely odds of getting help in the future if they associate said frustration to the asker. 

##  Example of a S.M.A.R.T Question
[SMART Question Example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79665515/docker-compose-env-not-loading-applied-to-container)

The link above is an example of the smart way of asking a question we go into StackOverflow. 
The headline of the title “docker-compose.env not loading/applied to container” displays a clear issue of the code without being overbearing or begging, which is so far a good start. 
The author then displays the .yml, .env files including the description of the problem as well as their config results. 
After displaying the code and laying down the problems he/she is currently facing, the author then asks the question, “What should I do so that the env variables are loaded to the postgres?”. 
The string of events leading up to the question are what makes that post a smart question because it displays willingness to learn and that an attempt was made. 

## Example of a not S.M.A.R.T Question
[Not SMART Question Example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79665475/can-anyone-help-me-with-scraping-data-from-a-website-using-html-session)

The subject header is as follows: “Can anyone help me with scraping data from a website using html_session?”. 
The problem with this subject header is its vagueness in the words “Can anyone help me…” this does not address any nor highlight a problem within a glance. 
It is also clear that the author made no effort within his work located within the quote “I found this code on stack overflow but it is giving me an error:...” 
This quote highlights that the author did not do his or her homework and is asking others to do their debugging for them. 
There was also no effort to debug the pasted code as there exist no other file other than the copied code. 
This is an example of a question that does not follow Raymond’s standard and an example of what not to do when asking questions on StackOverflow.

## Epilogue

Overall, Raymond’s guide on smart questions are important for clear and concise communication on coding issues. 
Following these guidelines ensures that one’s questions are less likely to get dismissed, 
cause less frustrations within others, showcase that one is willing to learn which garners support and respect, and increase odds of getting precise help. 
These two examples are contrasts of one another that formulate how to ask a coding question in a way that garners more support and decreases the chances of being ignored.
