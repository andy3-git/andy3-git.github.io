# Introduction

Throughout my third year in college, A.I. such as ChatGPT became a major part of my academic life. ChatGPT can be a useful tool for studying as it can explain concepts as well as give necessary info such as formulas or why a piece of code works or doesn’t work. In the case of Software Engineering, Artificial intelligence can be used to solve repetitive problems, catch errors, and enhance productivity. Throughout Software Engineering, I have mainly used ChatGPT, which has been a particular help in understanding concepts unfamiliar to me as well as error catching and fixing said errors. I haven’t used any of the other AI tools since ChatGPT had everything I was looking for during the course.

# What I Used A.I. For

- Experience WODs e.g. E18  
- In-class Practice WODs  
- In-class WODs  
- Essays  
- Final project  
- Learning a concept / tutorial  
- Answering a question in class or in Discord  
- Asking or answering a smart-question  
- Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”  
- Explaining code  
- Writing code  
- Documenting code  
- Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code (code here)” or “Fix the ESLint errors in (code here)”  
- Other uses in ICS 314 not listed  

## Item 1

In this section, I will address the list in how I used ChatGPT for this list. 
For Item 1, I was having issues with installing postGreSQL which was losing me plenty of points. 
I couldn’t figure out why I was having issues with installation so I asked ChatGPT. 
That was the best decision, as asking A.I. gave me all the information needed to install PostgreSQL and continue forth with the rest of the assignments that required PostgreSQL.

## Items 2 and 3

Our class was asynchronous, meaning that we never met in person for this quote.
I am putting these two items together because they are practically the same and to my knowledge we never had an in person practice WOD. 
Without further ado, A.I helped me solve the WODs in an efficient time. Oftentimes during real WODs, I would copy the prompt into ChatGPT and watch it do most of the hard bundle of repetitive typing. 
The output of ChatGPT is not perfect, but still provides a solid foundation to work upon.
Each WOD is 1 hour long; doing this saved me tons of time as I could finish it in less than 20 minutes and spend the rest of the time tweaking changes and fixing errors.

## Item 4

In this course, we had to do a lot of typing for our portfolios (even though this class is not writing intensive somehow but I digress). 
In this aspect, I utilized ChatGPT to help me research topics that I never fully understood. 
This saved me the headache of looking through various articles on the web. Furthermore, ChatGPT makes for a great peer reviewer. 
I paste my essay into the prompt and it suggests corrections to spelling and grammar. 
To be clear, these words are my own as I have already written them before insertion to the A.I., and I have never asked the A.I to write an essay for me in this course. 
That is cheating, and removes the soul of the essay as it is no longer my thoughts but of a machine.

## Item 5

During our asynchronous final project, I had used ChatGPT to give us a solid foundation on our club finder project by giving us a club template to put in data. 
The foundation built is what dictated the rest of the project and how data is placed within. 
I had also used A.I to figure out how to pull versions of Repo from GitHub into VSCode without breaking anything within our Repository.

## Item 6

I utilize ChatGPT all the time when going into shaky territory such as learning a new concept. 
For example, I asked A.I. to explain to me how the React template worked. 
I have learned how the file system works within Next.js utilizing components and page.tsx. To say that A.I. has helped me learn is an understatement; 
it has built my understanding within a class where coming across a professor or TA wasn’t easy.

## Item 7

I have never used ChatGPT for asking a question in Discord. I didn’t ask too many questions in Discord. 
The few notable times I remember was during our first “in-class WOD” paradoxical I know due to the class being asynchronous. 
It was more of an issue with organization in my opinion but I never really needed A.I to ask that because that’s something that A.I can’t solve.

## Item 8

During the course of this class, I have never answered or asked a S.M.A.R.T question. 
However, during our writing on S.M.A.R.T questions found on StackOverflow, I did use ChatGPT to help me understand why a question may be S.M.A.R.T or may not be following Raymond’s guide to asking a S.M.A.R.T question. 
In that aspect, it was useful in providing the necessary understanding needed to write that essay.

## Item 9

Over the course of Software Engineering, I don’t recall utilizing A.I to give me an example of a coding concept in code. 
I definitely have asked A.I. to understand a snippet of code for me but I have never directly asked for an example. 
As for why, I just didn’t find it useful for me to ask for a coding example as I had other issues and assignments to do for not just Software Engineering, but for all my other courses I’m taking during the summer.

## Item 10

This ties in a little bit into Item 9, I used ChatGPT to help me understand a bit of code that I didn’t understand. 
It was more useful to me than asking for an example because the code was already there and had a tangible effect. 
However, doing this style of prompting rather than the other style of asking for an example may cost me true understanding as I was looking at a more broader picture rather than a single aspect of a code.

## Item 11

I have definitely used ChatGPT to write code. Almost to a point of addiction since it was almost too effective to do otherwise. 
I have solved WODS, practice WODS, and everything else with this method. 
As easy as this was, it did have a cost, a cost of ultimate understanding within the code I was writing. 
I know this will impact me when I need to go back and change the code or when I’m explaining the code to others. 
I just hope that I can still be a good Software Engineer in the future despite this.

## Item 12

I never utilized A.I to document my code for me. My documentations are relatively simple in general. I just write “// Function does X” and that just about suffices for me. I never needed A.I. to do that for me as it seems redundant at the time. I’ll consider this next time I write code to see what it does for me.

## Item 13

ChatGPT played a big role in figuring out how to solve errors when they popped up. During our final project I had issues with conflicting merges and I needed to revert my changes in VSCode to go back to the code utilized in our Github Repository. ChatGPT guided me through reverting the code back to the original state so I can utilize their Repository code without any future conflicts. Without the use of A.I. I would have been lost, being unable to make significant progress for my organization.

## Item 14

I cannot think of any other use cases of A.I. during Software Engineering. The previous 13 Items have covered all bases that I would think of had I not been provided with this list.

# The Impacts of Learning and Understanding

As an avid user of ChatGPT, it has affected my level of understanding, skill development, and problem-solving skills in an ultimately negative way. 
I will say that it is very efficient to just ask ChatGPT for everything. But in doing so, it has hampered any form of understanding as I became overreliant on these tools. 
I am not able to solve problems conventionally through thinking and ingenuity because I never needed to. 
I let A.I. do the thinking for me and for that I have paid the price multiple times during exams from other classes. Let this be a lesson, never become overly reliant to the point of addiction.

# Practical Application

Beyond the Software Engineering course, A.I has played a fundamental role in events such as the HACC (Hackathon and Collaborative Coding). 
There, tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT increase development rate, automate tests, and offer real time problem solving. 
This allows the team to innovate rather than boilerplate tasks. However, this effectiveness depends on the user's ability to properly prompt, assess, and adapt to AI output. 
AI has proven useful for error catching, writing repetitive code, and debugging.

# Challenges and Opportunities

Within ICS 314, more of the challenges were having the A.I. produce exactly what I wanted. Particularly with the bootstrap website choice practice WOD. 
I had a hard time fixing a visual error that was not aligning a black bar with the screenshot of the American Truck. 
I had prompted the A.I. to fix this over and over but the changes suggested never had a serious effect.
I eventually gave up entirely and posted the spoof website as is.

# Comparative Analysis

Traditional teachings back in the day involved reviewing slides, listening to a professor talk about a subject for an amount of time, and reviewing a textbook. 
They offer structured learning and a means to build skills brick by brick. However, some students may find it difficult to focus during class. 
AI-enhanced learning allows for instant feedback and in a way a safety net when used to code and learn at the same time. 
They can be used to prompt for practice coding demand or assist with error correction. But, AI use can be addictive and destructive for learning if abused. 
For learning, AI should complement rather than replace traditional teachings altogether.

# The Future

I think that AI can provide great benefits towards learning Software Engineering. 
From providing example codes and problems to breaking down complex concepts into more simple explanations. 
AI has a plethora of applications in Software Engineering due to its versatility. 
However, I think the challenge is combating overuse of AI, as it can lead to dependency on it causing hindrance in learning the course. 
I don't think there's not much to improve in my opinion because A.I is kind of out of control. 
There can be limitations established but how does one go about enforcing that? I think there’s potential for good things, we are just gonna have to wait and see.

# The Finale

To summarize, I have reflected on having used AI since my 3rd year in college. 
While it has increased my efficiency and provided me with invaluable assistance, I cannot deny that it has posed challenges, such as overreliance and hindered understanding. 
Balancing AI with traditional methods of learning as well as critical thinking is essential to becoming a proper software engineer. 
As this technology evolves, I think that their role in education will expand, allowing for new opportunities as well as new challenges for the foreseeable future. Thanks for reading.
