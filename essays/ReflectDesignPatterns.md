## The Definition of Design Patterns
In any software development firm, design patterns are reusable solutions to problems that appear frequently.
These are not copy-paste templates, but rather common practice approaches that can be adapted to solve different kinds of problems. 
There are three different categories of Design Patterns, and they come with several different types. 
Think of this as being in city development where your city needs houses (components), roads (user-interfaces), traffic systems (data flow), and services (business logic).
It would not make much sense to rebuild houses from complete scratch. Instead, you would want to reuse parts from urban planning that have already been proven to work to save time. 
Same with software development, instead of writing code from complete scratch every single time. 
Software developers use components from other code that already work to solve recurring problems quicker, thus saving time. 

## Essential Tools For Efficient Development
Asking any software developer if they’ve used design patterns is like asking someone if they’ve ever eaten steak with a fork and a knife. 
It’s second nature for developing more complex programs. 
During my time studying Software Engineering, we had several different assignments regarding React and next.js frameworks. 
The heart of next.js is the src/app, within that folder came with public, and components folders. 
We were tasked with replicating various sites utilizing Bootstrap 5 and React. 
Rather than creating these projects from scratch per assignment, I reused structures I knew worked within the limits of next.js, 
in particular the public for the static files such as images and the components folder which held all the .tsx files necessary. 
Without design patterns, building these projects foundation-side up would take several times longer than utilizing design patterns of my knowledge about next.js. 

## Epilogue - To Reflect
My time with next.js and React has told me that design patterns are efficient tools. 
Whether they are used to recreate components, manage application logic, or to simply save time.
Design patterns present a structured form of thinking based on solutions already built and proven. 
Over time as I grow, these patterns will serve as both a shortcut and as guides, helping me write more cleaner, maintainable code, whilst streamlining development for future projects.
