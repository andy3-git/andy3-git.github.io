## Origins of My Software Engineering Experience

Software Engineering was a class that stirred up many emotions.
From happy moments of passing a WOD to anguish and sadness when my postgreSQL didn’t work. 
My first attempt with this course was in Fall of 2024.
I didn’t stay for long, because I ended up dropping out of the course because I couldn’t figure out how to set up my Github portfolio, 
failing the 2nd WOD regarding constructors in typescript, and several of my essays ended of being a zero due to the Github Portfolio being poorly set up. 
This drastically lowered my grade to a point where I thought it wasn't salvageable. 
So the only option I had was to drop the course and pursue other classes. 
I was supposed to take this course during Spring of 2025, 
but due to some issues I wasn’t able to take those courses and so I was forced to take this course during the Summer of 2025, 
and even then I was still having difficulties in the class.
Such as understanding typescript, bootstrap, as well as outside factors such as work and other classes. 
I was lost at the time, I still am with how much I doubt myself but hopefully, I can still pull through with this. Just one more year left.

## The Simple Yet Importance of Coding Standards

Coding Standards, what are they and how is it important. Coding Standards are a set of agreed rules that developers follow when writing code. 
This ensures that the overall code is maintainable, consistent, readable, and efficient. 
By following these, teams are able to understand one another's work, reduce errors, and update it without clashes. 
Without these standards, code written becomes messy, inefficient, and difficult to maintain. 
These are mostly applied in Web Application Development but extend to other places. 
Good Game development follows coding standards to keep large projects from becoming large, unintelligible, messy bundles of code.
Another example is in embedded systems, where coding standards such as the MISRA C helps making sure that code is safe and reliable 
in resource constrained environments such as automotive systems, medical devices, and aerospace. Without these standards, one could bet that most of these systems and projects will fail whenever a developer tries to make an update. 
Hence the importance of Coding Standards cannot be overlooked, as simple as that concept sounds. 

## The Power of User Interface Frameworks

User Interface Frameworks, during this course I have used this several times in order to ensure completion of assignments without having to create everything from scratch. 
They are a collection of pre-built components, tools, and guidelines for coding developers to help create interfaces that are consistent, visually appealing and functional for applications. 
This improves efficiency in developers as it eliminates the need to build from scratch each time. Most notably used in Web Development but they have other uses outside of that field. 
Game Development utilizes UI Frameworks in engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine, allowing developers to create menus, huds, stores, and other interactive elements without needing to create from scratch each time. 
Overall, User Interface Frameworks allow developers to be more efficient by having reusable components, enforce design consistency, and accessibility. 
Their importance is in the roots of any other form of interactive system besides a browser. 

## Epilogue 

Whether it is the simplicity of Coding Standards or the visual design provided by User Interface Frameworks. 
Both of these topics play a role in the success of software development, 
Coding Standards for delivering a set of agreed rules that ensure quality whilst being easy to read and modify, 
and User Interface Frameworks for having pre-built components that make setting up a User Interface much quicker than building from scratch.
However they are small parts of a large machine, with the goal of building software that works well, lasts for a long time, and is understandable by both its users and developers. 
Without these topics in play, development would be slow, riddled with unorganized code, and ultimately deliver a sub-optimal product that is hard to understand for both sides of the coin: developers and users.
