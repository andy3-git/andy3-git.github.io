## Impressions About Typescript

My current impression as a beginner of Typescript is that it feels familiar. This is because I had experience with Eclipse IDE that we were required to download during ICS 111 at UH Manoa. 

The programming language that Eclipse utilized was Java, which is similar to Javascript and typescript but different enough to mess with me. Typescript is far more simple than C and C++ so it’s easier to learn than those programming languages. 

Honestly when I was looking at how types are declared in functions and how the return type was determined I was incredibly confused. But after doing the first credited WOD, I can see that Typescript is not so different in syntax than Java is. 

For those that don’t know, a ‘WOD’ stands for Workout Of the Day (I’ll be abbreviating this to ‘WOD’ from this point forward). 

WODs in ICS 314, essentially functions as a quiz that starts at the beginning of class once per week which asks you to code a solution to scenarios or questions most interviewers ask.  

## Impressions About WODs

Since WODs in ICS 314 are essentially just quizzes at the beginning of class I always get anxious over them. One of my weaknesses in regards to coding is syntax. 

I find it hard for me to remember the nooks and crannies of syntax for any language, not just Typescript.

I had previously done a WOD last year in spring and it was intense due to points being at stake and it was live in the classroom. 

At the time of writing this in Summer of 2025, WODs start on Friday at 10:30 A.M. and end at 11:00 A.M giving a time frame of 30 minutes to either complete the problem or cry and fail in that order. 

## Impressions About Type of Learning

Although asynchronous classes may lack the in person experience meaning that it’s harder to make connections or friends, the silence is kind of comforting. 

WODs are another way of learning since it forces you to think on your feet unlike reading a bunch of slides. However, learning this way is stressful since WODs are an all or nothing kind of deal where you either get all points or none at all. 

This kind of stress is rewarding when you finish the WOD but also devastating as it felt like failing horribly. Although it is very nice that they let you use A.I, for me it covers my weakness with syntax but I know A.I can’t help with everything.

## The Wrap Up

In case this document was too long for reading. I stated that Typescript is a simple programming language that is similar to Java and Javascript but felt that the syntax was different enough to leave me confused. 

I then stated that WODS while stressful and punishing if failed can make you think on your feet and feel rewarded for doing so. 

Furthermore, I went on to say that this type of learning is more engaging than presentation slides as it forces you to think quickly and on your feet whilst allowing access to all tools at disposal such as open notes or A.I, relying less on 
memorization unlike other forms of learning. Though I’m not gonna lie, I’ll probably grow a couple white hairs by the time that this course is over.
