## About

This is a typescript project involving the Wind Chill formula with variables ivolving temperature in Fahrenheit [T] and Wind Speed [V] in miles per hour.
Wind Chill is feels like of how cold it actually is on the skin whenever the wind is blowing on said skin.
We use this formula Wind_Chill (in Fahrenheit) = 35.74 + 0.6215 * T - (35.75 * V)^0.16 + 0.4275 * T * V^16 to find the temperature it feels like on the skin.
Finally we use thresholds indicated in the image above to determine danger level of Hypothermia.
